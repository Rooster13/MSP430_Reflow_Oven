MSP430_Reflow_Oven
==================

Reflow Oven Controller Using an MSP430G2553 Launchpad

  Version: 1.0

  Overview
  =========
  This code is used to control a reflow oven. It allows for the option to change
  solder types (lead vs. lead-free) before each time the reflow process is started.
  Definitions for both profiles are included in this code. This code is designed to
  work with the Reflow Oven Controller BoosterPack designed by Juan Chong. It uses
  the MAX31855 thermocouple chip and library and an on-board LCD screen for status
  display on the fly. A PID controller library is used to control the system.
